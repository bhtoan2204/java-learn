## Recommendation for Payment Service Design

I believe this project should be **specifically designed for the payment service** to fully take advantage of its benefits. 

This is because **payment data is highly sensitive**, and **auditability is essential**. A well-architected design will ensure:

- Enhanced **security** for sensitive financial information  
- **Reliable traceability** and auditing for compliance  
- Better **fault isolation**, reducing risks to the broader system  
- Flexibility for implementing **CQRS and Event Sourcing** patterns, if needed  

By isolating the payment service, we can optimize it for the unique requirements of handling transactions, fraud detection, and financial integrity.
